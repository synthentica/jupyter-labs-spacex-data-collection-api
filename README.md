Introduction
This project will execute analysis on the basis of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings, predicting success. In their
own class, Falcon 9 rockets were because of the reusing ability, enabling SpaceX to provide much better costs
compared with other space launch service providers. The study aims at the benefits derived from data analysis in
realizing those factors that influence the successful landing and then finding out if it is possible to predict the results
in a reliable way. These facts have the potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs, as well as improve the
success rate of future launches.

Problems for which an answer is sought:
• What are the determining factors in the success of the Falcon 9 first-stage landings?
• Can you accurately predict the outcome of the Falcon 9 landings from given conditions of orbit type, payload
mass, and launch site?
• How does proximity to different types of geographical features affect the success rates at launch sites?
• Under what conditions would stage one of the Falcon 9 most likely land successfully?
• The project does not only contribute to the betterment of SpaceX's operation but also serves as a case study for
other aerospace companies that would be looking onward to minimize launch costs using reusable technology.
